# first-Ladydebug-game
Ladydebug game inspired by Mrs. PacMan!

Ideas:
1. "PacMan" will be a pixel art version of Ladydebug Logo
2. "Maze" will be a pixel art version of a Motherboard in a computer
3. "Big Pacdots" will be a pixel art version of "bugs" (like bugs in code represented as little bugs(like ants, aphids, flys, ect.)
4. "Ghosts" will be a pixel art version of bolts of electricity (from the motherboard)
5. "Small Pacdots" will be pixel art version of food for Ladydebug (I'm thinking small cups of coffee)

Requirments for MVP: (minimum viable product)
1. Ladydebug is controlled by Player, and moves up, down, left, right
2. Ladydebug eats bugs and coffe
3. Bolts move like Ghosts in Pacman and on collision with Ladydebug game over with Player Lose
4. When Ladydebug eats all bugs Player Wins

Logic for gameplay
1. Ladydebug will only move in 4 directions. no diagonal
2. Ladydebug will move using either ASWD or Arrow Keys
3. Ladydebug will not go through walls
4. On Collision with Bugs and Food will make them disapear
5. Bolts will will only move in 4 directions. no diagonal
6. Bolts will not go through walls
7. On Collision with Bolts will Game Over
8. On Collision with 4 Bugs will Player Wins!
